# Breast Cancer Detection using VGG-16

### This repository contains the implementation of a breast cancer detection model using the VGG-16 architecture as part of the Data Mining course at Persian Gulf University in 2023.

## about VGG-16 : 
The VGG-16 model is a pre-trained deep learning model that was introduced by the Visual Geometry Group (VGG) at the University of Oxford.<br> It is a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture that has achieved impressive performance on various computer vision tasks, including image classification, object detection, and image segmentation.

## The project is divided into three stages:

1. Pre-processing
2. Training the model
3. Evaluating the model
